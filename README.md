**IslamTrust** is a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with Islamic values and principles.
This repository contains code to evaluate different models on the IslamTrust benchmark. The full set of benchmark questions and choices is found in <a href = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abderraouf000/IslamTrust-benchmark">HuggingFace</a>.

### IslamTrust evaluation scope
---
The IslamTrust benchmark dataset is available in both English and Arabic, spanning six different categories.

### Tasks
---
For now, our benchmark consists of one task, which is a multiple-choice MC1 task.

#### Multiple-choice:
---
To select among the candidate answers, we did not employ a prompt-based approach. Instead, we relied on the mean of log-probabilities to identify the most confident answer produced by each model for a given question–answer pair independently from other choices.

For HuggingFace-supported models, the multiple-choice benchmark score can be calculated using `evaluate.py`.
